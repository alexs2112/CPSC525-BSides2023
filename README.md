Storing the notes that I have taken here to submit as participation for CPSC 525

Overall, a very interesting security conference. I think I learned a lot about general security practices and there was some pretty cool presentations as well. My favourite one was [[Ultrasonic Sound for Data Exfiltration.md]].
